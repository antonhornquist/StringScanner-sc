# StringScanner-sc

StringScanner for SuperCollider ported from Ruby Standard Library

## Requirements

These classes were developed and have been tested in SuperCollider 3.6.6.

## Installation

Copy the `StringScanner-sc` folder to the user-specific or system-wide extension directory. Recompile the SuperCollider class library.

The user-specific extension directory may be retrieved by evaluating `Platform.userExtensionDir` in SuperCollider, the system-wide by evaluating `Platform.systemExtensionDir`.
